# Simulator-for-Electric-Vehicles-Charging-Behaviour
The simulator simulating electronic vehicle charging behaviour in a specified traffic condition on the real world map. With the simulator, it is convenient to visualize the electric vehicles charging behaviour and the data generated by simulation can be used for the performance evaluation and validation.

Current Issue:

Random generater:
The random generater is based on the pixel points on the map  rather than all the gerorgraphic location within the zone.
